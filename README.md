- 👋 Hi, I’m Dave (@DTrostQorvo)
- 🌱 I’m currently tracking down high coupling between legacy tools in the tapeout flow
- 👀 I’m interested in building high cohesion tools that streamline our dataflow
- 💾 I want to learn about Qorvo's available options for databases, what makes them work well in a tech stack, and how to apply source control practices to Appian databases
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a mentorship program for Qorvo software engineers
- 📫 Reach out to me in Teams!
